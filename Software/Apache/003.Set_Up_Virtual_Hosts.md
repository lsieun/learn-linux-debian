## 1. What’s Apache Virtual Host?

Apache Virtual Hosts are used to run more than one web site(domain) using a single IP address. In other words you can have multiple web sites(domains) but a single server. Different sites will be shown depending on the user’s requested URL. Best part is you can have any number of virtual hosts in a single server. It simply means you can have any number of web sites(domains) in a single server.

As you see in the above picture, requests from each domain will be mapped into respective document root. If you don’t know what document root means it is where all the files of the website are located(could be `public_html`).

## 2. Prerequisites

To set up a virtual host you should have the following. What we call “prerequisites”.

- Apache web server
- Directory which keeps the website’s files(`/var/www/example.com/public_html`)
- Correct permission, `755` for folders and `644` for files

## 3. Create the Directory Structure

Each domain hosted on our server will have its document root set to

```txt
/var/www/<domain_name>/public_html.
```

Let’s start by creating the document root directory for our first domain, example.com:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/public_html
```

File: `/var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html`

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Welcome to example.com</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Success! example.com home page!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

We are running the commands as a `sudo` user and the newly created files and directories are owned by the `root` user.

To avoid any permission issues we’ll change the ownership of the domain document `root` directory and all files within that directory to the apache user (`www-data`):

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data: /var/www/example.com
```

在`/etc/passwd`中，还真有`www-data`用户：

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep www-data
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin

$ cat /etc/group | grep 33
www-data:x:33:
```

## 4. Create a Virtual Hosts

On Debian systems, Apache Virtual Hosts configuration files are located in `/etc/apache2/sites-available` directory and can be enabled by creating symbolic links to the `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled` directory.

File: `/etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf`

```txt
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName example.com
    ServerAlias www.example.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html

    <Directory /var/www/example.com/public_html>
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example.com-error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/example.com-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

- `ServerName`: The domain that should match for this virtual host configuration. This should be your domain name.
- `ServerAlias`: All other domains or subdomains that should match for this virtual host as well, usually the www subdomain.
- `DocumentRoot`: The directory from which Apache will serve the domain files.
- `Options`: This directive controls which server features are available in a specific directory.
  - `-Indexes`: Prevents directory listings.
  - `FollowSymLinks`: When this option is enabled Apache will follow the symbolic links.
- `AllowOverride`: Specifies which directives declared in the `.htaccess` file can override the configuration directives.
- `ErrorLog`, `CustomLog`: Specifies the location for log files.

To enable the new virtual host file, create a symbolic link from the virtual host file to the `sites-enabled` directory, which is read by Apache during the startup.

In Debian systems you can enable the virtual host by using a helper script named `a2ensite`:

```bash
sudo a2ensite example.com
```

The other option is to manually create a symlink as shown below:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
```

Once the configuration is enabled test if the syntax is correct by typing:

```bash
sudo apachectl configtest
```

If there are no errors you will see the following output:

```txt
Syntax OK
```

Restart the apache2 service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

> Remember whenever you make configuration changes you should restart Apache server.

To verify that everything works as expected, open `http://example.com` in your favorite browser.

Disable the virtual host

```bash
sudo a2dissite example.com
```
