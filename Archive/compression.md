# Compression

A `.gz` extension refers to a file compressed with the `gzip` utility. `gzip` is the fast and efficient traditional `Unix` utility to compress files. Newer tools achieve better rates of compression but require more resources (computation time and memory) to compress and uncompress a file. Among them, and by order of appearance, there are `bzip2` (generating files with a `.bz2` extension), `lzma` (generating `.lzma` files) and `xz` (generating `.xz` files).
