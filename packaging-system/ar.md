# ar

As for the `ar` program, it allows handling files of the same name: `ar t archive` displays the list of files contained in such an archive, `ar x archive` extracts the files from the archive into the current working directory, `ar d archive file` deletes a file from the archive, etc.

`ar` is a very rudimentary tool that a Unix administrator would only use on rare occasions, but admins routinely use `tar`, a more evolved archive and file management program.
